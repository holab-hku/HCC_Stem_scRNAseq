THE README_1_standard_workflow_before_rename.R script integrates the cells of all cell types in the six samples using the Seurat standard workflow. However, since it isn't possible to generate the exact same integration result (numbered clusters, UMAP coordinates) using different versions of R, Seurat, their dependencies, and different platforms, it is recommended to download our integrated Seurat object 6_samples_integrated_f500_npcs50_res2.rds by the link in the main README. Then, run scripts 2_ and 3_.

Similarly, the README_4_Exclude_non-HCC_and_others.R script integrates the HCC cells only in the six sample using the Seurat SCT workflow. Our integrated Seurat object for this, HCC.final.SCT_pc10_res0.1.rds, can also be downloaded by the link the main README. It will be needed by a number of scripts in other directories.
