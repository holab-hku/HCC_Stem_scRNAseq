For input to scVelo, we used the spliced/unspliced counts loom file generated by velocyto and the Seurat object loom file generated by loomR. These can be downloaded by the link in the main README.

For re-generating the above:
README_1_run_velocyto.pl runs velocyto on each sample's bam file. The bam file is obtained by aligning the raw reads to the mm10 reference genome using Cell Ranger. The raw reads can be downloaded in the GEO repository GSE181515.
README_2_merge_velocyto_loom.py merges the by-sample loom files obtained above into Pos.loom and Neg.loom.
README_3_extract_Seurat_loom.R extracts the Pos and Neg loom files of the Seurat object.

The figures are essentially reproducible using scVelo v0.2.4 (4_run_scVelo.ipynb). Original figures used in manuscript were ran with scVelo v0.2.3.dev34+gf7498c1 and therefore look marginally different (outs/Figure_6_and_S6/6E_S6D_scVelo_RNA_velocity).
